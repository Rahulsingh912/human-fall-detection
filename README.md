# Human Fall Detection using YOLOv8

This project implements a human fall detection system using YOLOv8 for real-time detection on live video streams. The model is trained on an image dataset containing various types of falls, including forward, backward, right, left, and standing falls.

## Overview

Falls among humans, especially the elderly, can lead to severe injuries and even fatalities. This project aims to address this issue by developing an automated fall detection system using computer vision techniques.

### Features

- Real-time detection of human falls in live video streams.
- Trained on a diverse dataset containing different types of falls.
- Utilizes YOLOv8 architecture for robust and accurate detection.
- Easy-to-use and deployable for various applications.

## Dataset

The model is trained on an image dataset curated specifically for human fall detection. The dataset includes images depicting various fall scenarios such as forward, backward, right, left, and standing falls. Each image is labeled with bounding boxes around the human subject(s) and annotated with the corresponding fall type.

## Usage

### Training

To train the YOLOv8 model on your custom dataset:

1. Prepare your dataset following the directory structure specified in the YOLOv8 repository.
2. Modify the configuration files (`data.yaml`, `yolov8s.yaml`, etc.) to suit your dataset and training requirements.
3. Run the training script, providing the necessary parameters and paths to your dataset.

### Inference

To perform inference on live video streams:

1. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, including YOLOv8 and related libraries.
2. Run the inference script, providing the path to the video source.


## Acknowledgments

- This project utilizes the YOLOv8 architecture developed by Ultralytics LLC.
- Special thanks to the contributors of the training dataset for their efforts in creating labeled images for fall detection.
